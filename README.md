# KMEANS-DBSCAN-ANOMALY
🚀 Exploring Clustering Techniques with K-Means and DBSCAN 🚀<br>

I recently delved into the fascinating world of clustering algorithms using a synthetic moon-shaped dataset. Here’s what I explored:<br>

🔍 K-Means Clustering:<br>
I utilized the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. The analysis revealed that k = [optimal_k] effectively captured the underlying structure of the data.<br>

🌌 DBSCAN Clustering:<br>
Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN allowed me to identify clusters of varying shapes and handle noise effectively. Points classified as anomalies were distinctly marked, showcasing DBSCAN's strength in dealing with outliers.<br>

⚖️ Comparison of Algorithms:<br>

K-Means excels in convex-shaped clusters but requires prior knowledge of the number of clusters.<br>
DBSCAN shines in identifying arbitrary shapes and managing noise, making it a robust choice for complex datasets.<br>
This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of how these algorithms can unveil patterns in data. I look forward to applying these insights in real-world applications!<br>
